The adage of ""It's who you know, not what you know"" really is difficult to reconcile when you feel like you have no network to get to your next career step.

Over the past 12 years, I heard this advice a lot as I moved around from city to city—both in the US and abroad. With every move, I had to rebuild my network, and it was *really* difficult each time.

If you're someone who's ever experienced a life transition, like a career change, having a child, or deciding to return to work after taking an extended leave, then this story is probably all too familiar.

If you're a woman, minority, or person with a non-traditional background which, when combined, represents the majority of the U.S. population, then it's *really* difficult to make any change because people already have these preconceived notions about you.

It's not an excuse, but an acknowledgment that biases are our reality.

Our reality is harsh on the job search. And we all could use help in fending off common biases in our job search so we can overcome the challenges we face in our transitions.

That's why we built JobFit - to help people in transition broaden the ""who you know,"" so you can show them your ""what you know."" We primarily assist people who are interested in transitioning to a new city for their next career step.

Whether you want to move for family, a change of scenery, or better opportunities, our goal is to help people find job referrals in cities where they want to work.

Find any job referral for any specific job to any particular company.

Our process of applying for job referrals is simple.

1. Find a company where you want a job referral.
2. Anonymously answer a few questions on what interested you about the company. Anonymity is to protect you from bias against your location, among other hiring bias.
3. A non-recruiter employee at the company will review your answers. If the employee likes your responses, they gain access to your name and resume for the job referral.


Here are some job referrals you can directly start connecting to right away:

Job Description

eAlchemy is looking for you– a smart, curious, and motivated leader with extensive experience in the Microsoft stack (.Net/VSTO/SQL) to help us boost our clients to new heights. You're excited to help people use data to make better decisions- you enjoy helping people, be they customers or coworkers. You love the challenge of software development, but not as its own end- you're interested in the clients' business challenges as much as the code because that's where you create real value.

And, equally as important, you care about building teams and processes that help deliver on the customer promise. Our team is small, but growing, and in need of a process-minded leader who can recognize what a team needs and nurture that. You have great skills and experiences, and want an opportunity to development your own team of developers.

This is a hands-on leadership role, and you'll be expected to code nearly every day. We typically use a front-end/back-end architecture that delivers critical information in various contexts– web, Power BI, and Excel. You should be comfortable throughout the stack and be nearly as comfortable with Javascript as you are with SQL.

We're based in Petaluma, CA, and our development team generally works from home 3 days/wk (currently in the office Monday and Wednesday). Please make sure you're willing to make that commitment prior to applying. If you're an exceptional non-local developer, a relocation stipend is available (requires relocation within 20 miles of our Petaluma office).

We're looking for employees- recruiters and service companies need not apply.

Please don't email us. Instead, apply here:  https://ealchemylabs.com/careers/ 

Desired Personal Characteristics

Smart and Curious- You're very smart, but more importantly, you're driven to understand how things work. You listen well because you want to understand the person and the problem better.

Accountable- You always feel personally responsible for the the success of everything you're affiliated with- quality, timelines, and budgets. You own the success and failures because you're passionate about success today and into the future.

Constructive- You're focused on positive outcomes for the team above all else. Ego takes a back seat. You project a positive energy and demonstrate awareness and concern for how you and the work you put forward is perceived.

Resilient & Flexible- You're very comfortable in an ever-changing and ambiguous world, comfortable admitting when you don't have the answer. Conversely, you should be savvy enough to know when failure is an acceptable outcome of measured risks. And, you're determined to develop skills, systems, and processes that mitigate those risks to ensure the greatest likelihood of success.

Service-minded- You have an innate desire to help others. You want everyone around you to be better, work better, enjoy more.

Innovative- Innovation is driven by perceptiveness and creativity. Your curiosity, attention, and ability to cull masses of information enable you to see things that others don't- patterns, anomalies, and pitfalls. And, in really understanding the challenge at hand, you're able to apply creative solutions that address the real issue.

Team-builder- While hands-on, you see and understand the big picture. You enjoy helping to develop people, teams, and processes. You want the challenge of helping take an organization to the next level.

Required Skills

8 years minimum experience with full stack .Net web development
2 years minimum experience managing a team
Ability to hand write complex SQL queries
Good communication skills (both written and verbal)
Familiarity with SSIS, SSAS, or SSRS
Some VBA a plus
A keen ability to understand business models and do root cause analysis on problems
A willingness and ability to learn new concepts quickly
You're a data magician--you love deriving business insights through thoughtful analysis of data sets

About eAlchemy
We're good people. To some, that doesn't matter much, but to us it's what matters most. It's the source of our growth--good people like to work with good people. We take our jobs, but not ourselves, seriously. We like to have fun, and we love helping other people solve their problems. Though we have high expectations and hire only great people, we're also fair, open, and honest. We'll accept nothing less from you!

Our benefits include medical, HSA, 401K, paid time off (20 day/year for FT employees), paid holidays (9 days/yr), and a flexible schedule.

About Our Business
eAlchemy is a small but profitable technology consultancy based in Petaluma, CA. Founded in 2009, we've seen tremendous growth, and we are hiring in anticipation of sustained growth into the forseeable future. We generally work with medium and large businesses, including several Fortune 500 companies--some of the most recognizable names in the Bay Area and beyond. Our customers span many industries (recruiting, retail clothing, and electronics), and we offer our expertise to help them use technology to solve problems and drive operational excellence.

Our team has a diverse set of technology skills, but our expertise is most evident in the practical application of them. Our core focus is building applications for business operations. We typically work with Excel, VBA, .NET, SQL Server, and various other platforms. As necessary, we utilize partnerships we've developed over the years to complement our own skill sets.    ",,DOE

We’re looking for the first engineer to join our team and help us build our platform to scale for growth. This work will demand full stack experience but because of the nature of the product, backend expertise is more important than frontend. 

Machine learning is the core of our product offering, so it's important that you're also excited to build scalable AI/ML systems end-to-end and embrace full stack data science.

Most importantly, you’ll be a very early employee and will work directly with the founders to not only shape and build the engineering team, but also the company. We’re excited to find a teammate who is excited to get into an early stage company because he/she loves to shape and mold things and excels with ambiguity and continuous iteration from testing and learning. We mostly work remotely but would love to find someone who lives in Marin and is tired of the commute to SF - we like to avoid commuting too!

About Novi:
We’re getting healthier, safer and more sustainable personal care products into the hands of consumers by changing the way the industry approaches product development. We’re driving transparency through the supply chain in a way that’s never been done before. We all passionately believe in the mission: every person deserves to have access to products that are better for you and better for the environment.

Help us build this technology platform from the ground up on a team that places as much value on a lunchtime run as a software release. Our motto: It’s a marathon, not a sprint - we love people who know how to pace themselves. We also don’t believe you have to be in an office together to be productive or to have a tight bond. So those who thrive working remotely will love it here.

Portrait Displays is a medium-sized, well-established software firm that makes the software that calibrates TVs and computer monitors.  We’re seeking a mid-career Software Engineer to work on the company’s flagship “CalMAN” product.  This is a desktop application written in C#/WPF that is the dominant product for calibrating video monitors around the world.

What You'll Be Doing:  You will work with a small team to maintain and enhance the world’s premier video monitor calibration solution.  Our stack is pretty straightforward:  a WPF desktop app sitting atop a C++ plugin library.  Typical development tasks run from diagnosing and fixing failure conditions in both native code and C#/WPF to architecting new application features for a complex desktop application that is deeply dependent on an MVVM architecture.  Beyond that, you’ll be expected to contribute to both software design and architectural decisions and also process and infrastructure issues.  To help you, you’ll have subject matter experts (the product, calibration processes), a few other devs and world-class color scientists from industry and academia.

Who Are We Looking For:
•	Passion for Software Engineering.  Your work is more than just a steady paycheck.  You really love this stuff:   you’ve got projects you’re proud of, work you love to talk about and stories about discovering new tools, tricks and technologies.  Extra credit for notable open source contributions.
•	Experience as a software engineer utilizing the Microsoft stack.  You’re comfortable with Visual Studio and have 3 years’ experience with C#, WPF and C++.  You’re cool with Git, believe in unit tests and appreciate a dedicated QA team.  Extra credit for passing the MCP exam.
•	Great team participation skills.  Your contributions run beyond writing code.  You care about shipping product and appreciate that this is more than just ticking off bugs on a punch list; so, you make sure QA knows how to test things and that PM understand where the risk is.  Visibility and confidence in the dev process are important to you so you push for light-weight, practical process improvements that facilitate this.  You proactively communicate, verbally and in writing, in English.


What Education You'll Need to Have: 

A minimum of a BS or BA in Computer Science, Physics, Math or similar discipline

Please note the following items before submitting your resume and cover letter:
•	This position is in-house only, the office is in Pleasanton, California
•	Relocation assistance not available.

The adage of ""It's who you know, not what you know"" really is difficult to reconcile when you feel like you have no network to get to your next career step.

Over the past 12 years, I heard this advice a lot as I moved around from city to city—both in the US and abroad. With every move, I had to rebuild my network, and it was *really* difficult each time.

If you're someone who's ever experienced a life transition, like a career change, having a child, or deciding to return to work after taking an extended leave, then this story is probably all too familiar.

If you're a woman, minority, or person with a non-traditional background which, when combined, represents the majority of the U.S. population, then it's *really* difficult to make any change because people already have these preconceived notions about you.

It's not an excuse, but an acknowledgment that biases are our reality.

Our reality is harsh on the job search. And we all could use help in fending off common biases in our job search so we can overcome the challenges we face in our transitions.

That's why we built JobFit - to help people in transition broaden the ""who you know,"" so you can show them your ""what you know."" We primarily assist people who are interested in transitioning to a new city for their next career step.

Whether you want to move for family, a change of scenery, or better opportunities, our goal is to help people find job referrals in cities where they want to work.

Find any job referral for any specific job to any particular company.

Our process of applying for job referrals is simple.

1. Find a company where you want a job referral.
2. Anonymously answer a few questions on what interested you about the company. Anonymity is to protect you from bias against your location, among other hiring bias.
3. A non-recruiter employee at the company will review your answers. If the employee likes your responses, they gain access to your name and resume for the job referral.

Job Description

eAlchemy is looking for you– a smart, curious, and motivated leader with extensive experience in the Microsoft stack (.Net/VSTO/SQL) to help us boost our clients to new heights. You're excited to help people use data to make better decisions- you enjoy helping people, be they customers or coworkers. You love the challenge of software development, but not as its own end- you're interested in the clients' business challenges as much as the code because that's where you create real value.

And, equally as important, you care about building teams and processes that help deliver on the customer promise. Our team is small, but growing, and in need of a process-minded leader who can recognize what a team needs and nurture that. You have great skills and experiences, and want an opportunity to development your own team of developers.

This is a hands-on leadership role, and you'll be expected to code nearly every day. We typically use a front-end/back-end architecture that delivers critical information in various contexts– web, Power BI, and Excel. You should be comfortable throughout the stack and be nearly as comfortable with Javascript as you are with SQL.

We're based in Petaluma, CA, and our development team generally works from home 3 days/wk (currently in the office Monday and Wednesday). Please make sure you're willing to make that commitment prior to applying. If you're an exceptional non-local developer, a relocation stipend is available (requires relocation within 20 miles of our Petaluma office).

We're looking for employees- recruiters and service companies need not apply.

Please don't email us. Instead, apply here:  https://ealchemylabs.com/careers/ 

Desired Personal Characteristics

Smart and Curious- You're very smart, but more importantly, you're driven to understand how things work. You listen well because you want to understand the person and the problem better.

Accountable- You always feel personally responsible for the the success of everything you're affiliated with- quality, timelines, and budgets. You own the success and failures because you're passionate about success today and into the future.

Constructive- You're focused on positive outcomes for the team above all else. Ego takes a back seat. You project a positive energy and demonstrate awareness and concern for how you and the work you put forward is perceived.

Resilient & Flexible- You're very comfortable in an ever-changing and ambiguous world, comfortable admitting when you don't have the answer. Conversely, you should be savvy enough to know when failure is an acceptable outcome of measured risks. And, you're determined to develop skills, systems, and processes that mitigate those risks to ensure the greatest likelihood of success.

Service-minded- You have an innate desire to help others. You want everyone around you to be better, work better, enjoy more.

Innovative- Innovation is driven by perceptiveness and creativity. Your curiosity, attention, and ability to cull masses of information enable you to see things that others don't- patterns, anomalies, and pitfalls. And, in really understanding the challenge at hand, you're able to apply creative solutions that address the real issue.

Team-builder- While hands-on, you see and understand the big picture. You enjoy helping to develop people, teams, and processes. You want the challenge of helping take an organization to the next level.

Required Skills

8 years minimum experience with full stack .Net web development
2 years minimum experience managing a team
Ability to hand write complex SQL queries
Good communication skills (both written and verbal)
Familiarity with SSIS, SSAS, or SSRS
Some VBA a plus
A keen ability to understand business models and do root cause analysis on problems
A willingness and ability to learn new concepts quickly
You're a data magician--you love deriving business insights through thoughtful analysis of data sets

About eAlchemy
We're good people. To some, that doesn't matter much, but to us it's what matters most. It's the source of our growth--good people like to work with good people. We take our jobs, but not ourselves, seriously. We like to have fun, and we love helping other people solve their problems. Though we have high expectations and hire only great people, we're also fair, open, and honest. We'll accept nothing less from you!

Our benefits include medical, HSA, 401K, paid time off (20 day/year for FT employees), paid holidays (9 days/yr), and a flexible schedule.

About Our Business
eAlchemy is a small but profitable technology consultancy based in Petaluma, CA. Founded in 2009, we've seen tremendous growth, and we are hiring in anticipation of sustained growth into the forseeable future.

We’re looking for the first engineer to join our team and help us build our platform to scale for growth. This work will demand full stack experience but because of the nature of the product, backend expertise is more important than frontend.

Most importantly, you’ll be a very early employee and will work directly with the founders to not only shape and build the engineering team, but also the company. We’re excited to find a teammate who is excited to get into an early stage company because he/she loves to shape and mold things and excels with ambiguity and continuous iteration from testing and learning. We mostly work remotely but would love to find someone who lives in Marin and is tired of the commute to SF - we like to avoid commuting too!

We’re driving transparency through the supply chain in a way that’s never been done before. We all passionately believe in the mission: every person deserves to have access to products that are better for you and better for the environment.

Help us build this technology platform from the ground up on a team that places as much value on a lunchtime run as a software release. Our motto: It’s a marathon, not a sprint - we love people who know how to pace themselves. We also don’t believe you have to be in an office together to be productive or to have a tight bond.

Software Engineer Posting:  WPF Developer (CalMAN Team),https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/sof/d/pleasanton-software-engineer-posting/7023414126.html,1574158740000, (dublin / pleasanton / livermore),"
        
Portrait Displays is a medium-sized, well-established software firm that makes the software that calibrates TVs and computer monitors.  We’re seeking a mid-career Software Engineer to work on the company’s flagship “CalMAN” product.  This is a desktop application written in C#/WPF that is the dominant product for calibrating video monitors around the world.

What You'll Be Doing:  You will work with a small team to maintain and enhance the world’s premier video monitor calibration solution.  Our stack is pretty straightforward:  a WPF desktop app sitting atop a C++ plugin library.  Typical development tasks run from diagnosing and fixing failure conditions in both native code and C#/WPF to architecting new application features for a complex desktop application that is deeply dependent on an MVVM architecture.  Beyond that, you’ll be expected to contribute to both software design and architectural decisions and also process and infrastructure issues.  To help you, you’ll have subject matter experts (the product, calibration processes), a few other devs and world-class color scientists from industry and academia.

Who Are We Looking For:
•	Passion for Software Engineering.  Your work is more than just a steady paycheck.  You really love this stuff:   you’ve got projects you’re proud of, work you love to talk about and stories about discovering new tools, tricks and technologies.  Extra credit for notable open source contributions.
•	Experience as a software engineer utilizing the Microsoft stack.  You’re comfortable with Visual Studio and have 3 years’ experience with C#, WPF and C++.  You’re cool with Git, believe in unit tests and appreciate a dedicated QA team.  Extra credit for passing the MCP exam.
•	Great team participation skills.  Your contributions run beyond writing code.  You care about shipping product and appreciate that this is more than just ticking off bugs on a punch list; so, you make sure QA knows how to test things and that PM understand where the risk is.  Visibility and confidence in the dev process are important to you so you push for light-weight, practical process improvements that facilitate this.  You proactively communicate, verbally and in writing, in English.


What Education You'll Need to Have: 

A minimum of a BS or BA in Computer Science, Physics, Math or similar discipline

Please note the following items before submitting your resume and cover letter:
•	This position is in-house only, the office is in Pleasanton, California
•	Relocation assistance not available.
